 Discrete Mathematics Toolkit (C++)

A C++ project that implements key Discrete Mathematics concepts through practical algorithms and problem-solving techniques.
The program demonstrates how theoretical discrete structures can be translated into efficient computational logic using clean, modular C++ code.
